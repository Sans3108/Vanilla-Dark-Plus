# Vanilla Dark Plus
A simple recolor of the otherwise classic client. Makes everything darker. The font has also been changed to [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito).

Colors can be easily changed to fit your needs inside the theme file, be it even darker or lighter. _(why would you want this)_

The theme is light mode compatible. _(again, what is wrong with you)_

_("compatible" here means: does not break light mode by making it dark, it doesn't make sense to make light mode be dark.)_

## Better Discord Installation
- Go inside your themes folder (User settings > Themes > "Open themes folder")
- Download the theme file ([Vanilla Dark Plus.theme.css](https://github.com/Sans3108/Vanilla-Dark-Plus/blob/master/Vanilla%20Dark%20Plus.theme.css))
- Move the file to the themes folder

### Other Clients
Good luck ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Issues
I will try my best to keep this theme updated, however if you spot something broken or not darkened up, and it's not fixed within a day, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Sans3108/Vanilla-Dark-Plus/issues/new) and be as descriptive as you can. Thank you!
